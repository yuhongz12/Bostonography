Is the readOGR approach from the rgdal package not working?  I'd try that first, loading the data via:

cal_spdf <- readOGR( dsn= ".", layer="CA_Counties_TIGER2016", verbose=FALSE)﻿﻿

And then you can go from there following the templates in the RMarkdown notes (I have rgdal, broom, and tidyverse loaded, in that order).

You can also try loading it with the sf package.  Following the example here ( https://github.com/allisonhorst/esm-244-lab-1 ) which may be where you found your data, you can load the shape file with:

ca_counties <- st_read(dsn = ".", layer = "CA_Counties_TIGER2016")

I also noticed at that git that in sf is a nice plot tool for ggplot2 that I wasn't aware of.  The demo code shows how to first easily merge data using the pipe %>% notation from tidyverse, and then using geom_sf in ggplot, with no need for "tidy" or "fortify" at all:

Read in new data with covariates on the counties and then rename the variable to merge on to match what's in the ca_counties (btw, you can see the non-geographic variables in there with "names(ca_counties)" ).

ca_pop_inc <- read_csv("ca_pop_inc.csv") %>% rename(NAME = COUNTY)

Now the nice part: the "join" functions in tidyverse recognize the shape object as a table with shapes attached, and merge it with the population data, returning another shape+data object:

ca_df <- full_join(ca_counties, ca_pop_inc) 

Now we can plot it using geom_sf in ggplot without need for "tidy" or "fortify":

ggplot(ca_df) +  geom_sf(aes(fill = MedFamilyIncome), color = "white", size = 0.2) +  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("blue","mediumorchid1","orange")) +  theme_minimal()

You can see more details at the github address above; I'll definitely be using this simplified approach in future versions of this module.
