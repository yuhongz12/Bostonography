Importing data

```{r}
require(ggplot2)

acs1216<-read.csv('ACS_1216_TRACT.csv')
bos_tracts<-read.csv('Tracts_Boston_2010_BARI.csv')
acs1216_bos<-merge(acs1216,bos_tracts,by='CT_ID_10',all.y=TRUE)
names(acs1216_bos)

```

Giving a summary about the median income for each census tract

```{r}
## Education
summary(acs1216_bos$LessThanHS)
summary(acs1216_bos$HSGrad)
summary(acs1216_bos$SomeColl)
summary(acs1216_bos$Bach)
summary(acs1216_bos$Master)
summary(acs1216_bos$Prof)
summary(acs1216_bos$Doc)
```

Creating a histogram for each education level and looking for a trend

```{r}
hist_lessThanHS <- ggplot(aes(x=LessThanHS), data=acs1216_bos) + geom_histogram(bins=10) + xlab('% Less Than High School') + ylab('# of tracts')
hist_lessThanHS

hist_HSGrad <- ggplot(aes(x=HSGrad), data=acs1216_bos) + geom_histogram(bins=10) + xlab('% High school Graduate') + ylab('# of tracts')
hist_HSGrad

hist_SomeColl <- ggplot(aes(x=SomeColl), data=acs1216_bos) + geom_histogram(bins=10) + xlab('% Some College') + ylab('# of tracts')
hist_SomeColl

hist_Bach <- ggplot(aes(x=Bach), data=acs1216_bos) + geom_histogram(bins=10)  + xlab('% Bachelors Degree') + ylab('# of tracts')
hist_Bach

hist_Master <- ggplot(aes(x=Master), data=acs1216_bos) + geom_histogram(bins=10) + xlab('% Masters Degree') + ylab('# of tracts')
hist_Master

hist_Prof <- ggplot(aes(x=Prof), data=acs1216_bos) + geom_histogram(bins=10)  + xlab('% Professional Degree') + ylab('# of tracts')
hist_Prof

hist_Doc <- ggplot(aes(x=Doc), data=acs1216_bos) + geom_histogram(bins=10)  + xlab('% Docorate Degree') + ylab('# of tracts')
hist_Doc
```

Let's say that we picked the median year of houses built as our categorical variable 
``` {r}

table(acs1216_bos$MedYrBuilt)

# Create a vector that has the labels for our categorical variable
vector_MedianYearBuilt <- c('Unknown','1940 to 1949','1950 to 1959','1960 to 1969','1970 to 1979','1980 to 1989','1990 to 1999','2000 to 2009','Prior to 1940')
```

We can see that majority of the houses in Boston are built prior to 1940

``` {r}
pie(table(acs1216_bos$MedYrBuilt), label=vector_MedianYearBuilt)
```

Let's divide the histogram with the median year of all the houses built for each education level
``` {r}

hist_lessThanHS1 <- hist_lessThanHS + geom_histogram(aes(fill=MedYrBuilt), bins=10) + scale_fill_hue(name="Education Level", labels=vector_MedianYearBuilt)
hist_lessThanHS1

hist_HSGrad1 <- hist_HSGrad + geom_histogram(aes(fill=MedYrBuilt), bins=10) + scale_fill_hue(name="Education Level", labels=vector_MedianYearBuilt)
hist_HSGrad1

hist_SomeColl1 <- hist_SomeColl + geom_histogram(aes(fill=MedYrBuilt), bins=10) + scale_fill_hue(name="Education Level", labels=vector_MedianYearBuilt)
hist_SomeColl1

hist_Bach1 <- hist_Bach + geom_histogram(aes(fill=MedYrBuilt), bins=10) + scale_fill_hue(name="Education Level", labels=vector_MedianYearBuilt)
hist_Bach1

hist_Master1 <- hist_Master + geom_histogram(aes(fill=MedYrBuilt), bins=10) + scale_fill_hue(name="Education Level", labels=vector_MedianYearBuilt)
hist_Master1

hist_Prof1 <- hist_Prof + geom_histogram(aes(fill=MedYrBuilt), bins=10) + scale_fill_hue(name="Education Level", labels=vector_MedianYearBuilt)
hist_Prof1

hist_Doc1 <- hist_Doc + geom_histogram(aes(fill=MedYrBuilt), bins=10) + scale_fill_hue(name="Education Level", labels=vector_MedianYearBuilt)
hist_Doc1

```


We can see that majority of the houses built in Boston are prior to 1940. Although there are some outliers in the graphs, we can see a trend that people with at least a high school graduate education level are more likely to live in newer houses that are built after 1940, compared to people with an education level of less than high school. We can analysis the median income and percentage of people of with an education of less than high school to see if there will be any correlation. 


``` {r}

plot_income_lessThanHS <- ggplot(data=acs1216_bos, aes(x=LessThanHS, y=MedHouseIncome)) + geom_point() + xlab("% Less Than High School") + ylab("Median House Income") + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
plot_income_lessThanHS

```

Here, we show that there is a negative correlation between the median house income and the percentage of people with education level of less than high school. This means as the percentage increase, the median income will decrease and vice versa. We can conclude that neighboorhoods with a higher rate of people with an education level of less than high school will have a lower income, which they may not have the money to live in new houses, leading to a higher rate of houses built prior to 1940.
